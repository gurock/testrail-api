-------------------------------
 
You can learn more about TestRail's API and how to use the Python binding here:

http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-api2/start

http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-api2/bindings-python

There are two versions of the bindings:  
- `testrail.py` - depends on the package `requests`
- `testrail2.py` - has no external dependencies

Both variants supporting the same interface, so you're able to
switch between them, without changing your code.
